Instructions for Docker DB Set Up

PreReqs: 
	1. Have Docker installed and running.
	2. VS Installer should show you have "ASP.NET and web development", "Azure Development", ".NET Desktop development"
	3. You have NuGet Packet Manager
	4. Have the following NuGet Packages:
		1) Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy
		2) Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
		3) Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
		4) Swashbuckle.AspNetCore

1) Create a new branch from main (In GitHub) and build the build.
2) Open Powershell terminal and copy the command in "run_db.sh" in Solution Items
3) Check Docker containers if "wifindthesql" and run it.
4) Open Azure Data Studio
5) Go to New then New connnection.
6) Change input type to Connection String.
7) Go back to VS, wiFind.Server, Connected Services and open Secrets.json (right click and choose manage)
8) Copy the content in the string.
9) Open Azure Data Studio and paste it into connection string. Connect.
	- It won't work if you dont have the container running.

10) Go back to VS and go to the NuGet Packet Manager Console.
	- (Tools -> NuGet Packet Manager -> Packet Manager Console)

11) Type Update-Database into the console.
	- Doing this will use the latest Migration file (found in the Migrations folder)
	- When db models are changed, these migrations makes it easier to change the db.
	- Sometimes, you may need to manually drop the tables in Azure Data Studio before you can update to a newer Migration. (First, Try 'Update-Database 0' to reset the database.)

12) Go back to Azure Data Studio and refresh your view.
13) The tables will be under Databases -> System Databases -> master -> Tables.
	- the project's table is called dbo._ (like dbo.Users)

14) Go back to VS and run the project. Open the client side link.
15) Some User objects are made as a test when the front end is opened.
16) Go back to Azure Data Studio, right click dbo.Users and choose "Select top 1000".
	- This runs a sql query on Users table and you should see some records with Ids.

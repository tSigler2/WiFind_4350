Instructions for Running with Project with DB

1) Clone project from GitHub via 'Open in Visual Studio'. Complete the cloning process.
2) Double Click on wiFind.sln to build the solution (client and server projects). Wait until this process is done because it will take a long time.
3) Go into Docker and Pause the container 'vs' that Visual Studio automatically made for you.

4) Open Developer Powershell terminal and copy the command in "run_db.sh" in Solution Items. Wait for this to finish because it will take forever too.
5) Check Docker containers if "wifindthesql" and that it is running.

6) In VS, open the packet manager console.
	- (Tools -> NuGet Packet Manager -> Packet Manager Console)

7) Type 'EntityFrameworkCore\Update-Database' into the console. You should expect a pause then some long log messages. For this to work, you do need to have docker connected.
	- If there's an error message then reach out to me because I'd have to read error messages again.

Optional for Visualization in Azure Data Studio

1) Open Azure Data Studio. Click New Connection. Choose Input type Connection String.
2) Copy Paste "Server=localhost, 1433; User Id=SA; Password=SQueaL4w1f1nd!; Integrated Security=False; MultipleActiveResultSets=True; TrustServerCertificate=True" and Connect.
	- if there is an issue, use input type parameters and use the string above to figure out which arguments belong where.
